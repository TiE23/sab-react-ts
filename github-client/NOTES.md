# Project 6 - GitHub Client with GraphQL

## What's Up
I simply copied the completed project from the sample code. Since I'm already familiar with using GraphQL and this lesson doesn't go into the details of making a GraphQL server I decided I'd just read through the lesson instead of writing the code myself. But, I also want to take copious notes on the entire project as well.

## Set-up Requirements
I use a .env file that contains my GitHub ID and Secret API credentials. While I don't intend to commit this to GitHub for public display, I still don't want to commit it.

The format is as such:
```
CLIENT_ID="asdasdasdasdasd"
CLIENT_SECRET="asdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasdasd"
```
